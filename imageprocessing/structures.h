 *  Revision 1.8  2020/01/01 09:22:01  goldin
 *  add code to calculate distance on per point basis and save in the db, also the percent of points matched
 *
 *  Revision 1.7  2019/06/12 11:48:09  goldin
 *  Working to evaluate quality of the results
 *
 *  Revision 1.6  2018/06/23 10:28:48  goldin
 *  continue working on pairing
 *
 *  Revision 1.5  2018/06/22 12:51:27  goldin
 *  Split into several C files, rework similarity
 *
 *  Revision 1.4  2018/06/11 11:23:56  goldin
 *  Still trying to identify parallel features
 *
 *  Revision 1.3  2018/06/07 11:16:17  goldin
